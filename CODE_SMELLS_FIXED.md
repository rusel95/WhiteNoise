# Code Smells Fixed

## Summary of Refactoring

### 1. âœ… Duplicate Code (DRY Violations)
- **Fixed**: Extracted `SoundPersistenceService` to a separate file in `/Services/`
- **Fixed**: Removed duplicate implementation from `SoundViewModel.swift` and `SoundFactory.swift`
- **Fixed**: Created gradient extensions in `AppConstants.swift` to eliminate repeated gradient definitions

### 2. âœ… Magic Numbers/Strings
- **Fixed**: Added constants to `AppConstants.swift` for:
  - UI sizes (icon sizes, font sizes, padding, corner radius)
  - Animation durations and steps
  - Timer intervals and multipliers
  - Opacity values
- **Fixed**: Updated all views and view models to use these constants

### 3. âœ… Force Unwrapping
- **Fixed**: Removed force unwrap in `Sound.swift` by adding proper validation and fallback handling

### 4. âœ… Large Methods
- **Fixed**: Refactored `SoundFactory.createSounds()` (115 lines) by:
  - Creating `SoundConfiguration.json` to store sound data
  - Creating `SoundConfigurationLoader` service to load data from JSON
  - Reducing method to configuration-based approach

### 5. âœ… Repeated Patterns
- **Fixed**: Created `HapticFeedbackService` to centralize haptic feedback logic
- **Fixed**: Updated `SoundView` and `WhiteNoisesView` to use the service

### 6. âœ… Better Separation of Concerns
- **Fixed**: Moved persistence logic to dedicated `SoundPersistenceService`
- **Fixed**: Moved sound configuration to external JSON file
- **Fixed**: Created loader service for configuration management

## Remaining Code Smells to Address

### 1. ðŸ”„ Large Classes (Still Need Work)
- `WhiteNoisesViewModel` (361 lines) - Handles too many responsibilities:
  - Audio session management â†’ Should move to `AudioSessionService`
  - Timer functionality â†’ Should move to `TimerService`
  - Remote commands â†’ Should move to `RemoteCommandService`
  - Now Playing info â†’ Should move to `NowPlayingService`
- `SoundViewModel` (261 lines) - Could benefit from extracting fade logic

### 2. ðŸ”„ Complex Methods (Still Need Work)
- `WhiteNoisesViewModel`:
  - `setupObservers()` - Should be split into smaller methods
  - `handleAppDidBecomeActive()` - Complex app lifecycle handling
  - `updateNowPlayingInfo()` - Complex calculation logic

### 3. ðŸ”„ Feature Envy
- `WhiteNoisesViewModel` still has too much knowledge about internal details of other components

### 4. ðŸ”„ Inappropriate Intimacy
- Direct access to `soundViewModel.volume` and other properties instead of using proper interfaces

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Better Maintainability**: Configuration-based sound management makes it easier to add/modify sounds
2. **Reduced Duplication**: Centralized services eliminate repeated code
3. **Type Safety**: Removed force unwrapping for safer code
4. **Consistency**: All UI constants in one place ensures visual consistency
5. **Testability**: Extracted services with protocols enable better unit testing
6. **SOLID Compliance**: Better adherence to Single Responsibility and Dependency Inversion principles

## Next Steps

To complete the refactoring:
1. Create `AudioSessionService` to handle audio session configuration
2. Create `TimerService` to manage timer functionality
3. Create `RemoteCommandService` for remote control handling
4. Create `NowPlayingService` for media player info
5. Simplify long methods in `SoundViewModel` by extracting fade logic
6. Update `WhiteNoisesViewModel` to use the new services
