These Terms of Service (the “Terms”) govern your use of the White Sound mobile application (the “App”). By downloading or using the App, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.

## 1. Subscription & Billing

- You can manage and cancel your subscription in your device’s Account Settings (App Store → Apple ID → Subscriptions).

## 3. Eligibility & Accounts
