# White Sound Privacy Policy

Effective date: 2025-09-16

This Privacy Policy explains how the White Sound mobile application (the “App”) collects, uses, and shares information. If you do not agree with this policy, please do not use the App.

## Summary
- We don’t create accounts or ask for your name or email.
- Sound preferences (e.g., volumes, selected variants) are stored locally on your device.
- Purchases are handled by Apple; we use RevenueCat to manage subscription status (entitlements).
- We don’t sell your data. We do not use third‑party advertising networks.

## Information We Collect
1. On‑device preferences
   - What: sound volumes, selected variants, and app settings stored locally (e.g., UserDefaults).
   - Purpose: provide and remember your preferred mix.
   - Retention: on your device until you delete the App or reset data.

2. Purchase & subscription data
   - What: transaction receipts and subscription status from Apple; app/device identifiers (e.g., IDFV) and purchase metadata via RevenueCat.
   - Purpose: verify eligibility, activate trial, unlock or restore subscription, prevent fraud, and support purchases across devices.
   - Retention: kept as necessary to operate subscriptions and comply with legal/financial obligations.

3. Diagnostics (optional)
   - What: crash logs, performance, and basic device context (OS version, app version). These may be provided by Apple and/or a diagnostics provider.
   - Purpose: improve stability and performance, investigate issues, and support users.
   - Retention: limited per provider’s policies.

We do not intentionally collect names, emails, contact lists, photos, precise location, or microphone recordings.

## How We Use Information
- Run and improve the App (mixing sounds, timers, background playback).
- Manage access to premium features (trial and subscription).
- Handle support and investigate technical issues.
- Comply with law and prevent fraud.

## Sharing of Information
- Apple (App Store / In‑App Purchases): to process payments and manage subscriptions.
- RevenueCat (Subscription Management): to verify entitlements, apply trials/offers, and restore purchases.
- Diagnostics providers (if enabled): to collect crash/performance data.
- We do not sell personal information. We do not share with ad networks.

## Children’s Privacy
The App may be used by children aged **4 and above** under a parent’s or guardian’s supervision. We designed White Sound to work without accounts and to store preferences locally. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

If a user is under the age of 13, a parent or legal guardian should review and consent to any in‑app purchase. Purchases are processed by Apple using the device’s Apple ID. We recommend enabling parental controls and Family Sharing where appropriate.

If you believe we have collected personal information from a child, or you would like such information deleted, please contact us and we will take reasonable steps to delete it in compliance with applicable law (including COPPA where applicable).

## Your Rights
Depending on your region (e.g., EEA/UK/California), you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict processing of your personal information. To exercise these rights, contact us.

## Security
We use reasonable safeguards to protect information. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

## International Transfers
Service providers may process information in countries other than your own. We rely on appropriate safeguards where required by law.

## Data Retention
- Local preferences remain on your device until you delete the App or reset data.
- Purchase records and entitlements are retained as needed to operate subscriptions and for legal/accounting requirements.
